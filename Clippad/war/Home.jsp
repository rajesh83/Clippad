			<p> Clippad is a small web application that can be used as an online clipboard-cum-notepad. Create a profile and you can store your clip-board items or small notes here. 
			You can access your notes from any of your devices connected to the internet - like you desktop, mobile phone or a tablet.This also enables you to transfer clip-board items from 
			one device to another - for instance, copy a contact or account number from your desktop, put it as a clip-item in your Clippad account, and you can access it from your phone 
			to be pasted as text in any of the apps; Or the other way round.There are control buttons to select and copy or edit your text-clips. No need to install any separate application;
			All you need is a good browser with JavaScript support. 
			
			<p> Creating a Clippad profile is very easy! Just sign-up providing a few basic details (No contact information required; Just your name 
			and new user credentials). Bookmark the login page with your credentials saved in your browser, and you can access all your favorite text clips/notes in a flash from anywhere! All 
			the text clips/notes that you enter are stored after encryption (with a key derived from your password, which itself is stored only after hashing). The only details visible at the back-end
			are your user id and name. So your profile is totally secure here.
